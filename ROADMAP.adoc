== Vision

**Journey Grammar for Databases (JGD)** is the cartographic infrastructure for mapping reality through data. Successor to VoID, Dublin Core, and DCAT.

**Core innovation**: The paradigm shift from black box obsession (interpretability) to white box in darkness (exploration of unmeasured reality).

== Milestones

=== Phase 1: Formal Specification (Q1 2026) ✓ In Progress

**Goal**: Complete formal specification across multiple systems.

=== Phase 2: Homoiconic Container Model (Q2 2026)

**Goal**: Implement storage containers as self-describing D_p instances.

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Component |Description

|jgd:StorageContainer
|Abstract type for storage systems (verisimdb, SQL, RDF, Graph)

|Self-Description API
|Containers describe their own structure using JGD

|Reflection API
|Containers examine and modify their structure

|Container Metadata
|Schema, indexes, storage format described in same grammar as contents

|verisimdb Implementation
|verisimdb as homoiconic D_p container

|Example Containers
|Reference implementations: RDF triplestore, SQL DB, property graph
|===

=== Phase 3: Metamorphic Library (Q3 2026)

**Goal**: Enable provable transformations between representations.

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Component |Description

|Transformation Catalog
|Valid transforms: RDF ↔ JSON-LD ↔ Graph ↔ SQL ↔ Document

|Invariant Proofs
|Idris2 proofs that transformations preserve semantics, provenance, coverage

|Transform API
|Functional API for metamorphic operations

|Metamorphic History
|Track container/data transformations over time

|Round-Trip Tests
|Validation that A → B → A preserves data

|Performance Benchmarks
|Measure transformation overhead
|===

=== Phase 4: Integration Ecosystem (Q4 2026)

**Goal**: Integrate with verisimdb, a2ml, k9-svc.

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Component |Description

|verisimdb Atlas
|Deploy verisimdb as cartographic index for D_p federation

|a2ml Compilation
|Compile JGD specs to SHACL, JSON Schema, ML models

|k9-svc Routing
|MIME type handling: application/vnd.jgd+turtle, +jsonld, +xml

|SPARQL Endpoint
|Temporal queries: "What did we know on 2020-01-01?"

|D_p Discovery
|Query for coverage gaps, blind spots, exploration priorities

|Federation Protocol
|How D_p instances register with atlas, discover each other
|===

=== Phase 5: Tooling & Libraries (Q1 2027)

**Goal**: Production-ready tools for JGD creation and validation.

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Component |Description

|Zig FFI Library
|C ABI validation library (homoiconic container implementation)

|Rust CLI
|Command-line tool: create D_p, validate, transform, query atlas

|ReScript Web UI
|Browser-based metadata creation, visualization

|Julia Batch Scripts
|Convert VoID/DC/DCAT to JGD at scale

|Python Bindings
|JGD library for Python data science ecosystem

|JavaScript SDK
|JGD for web applications (via Deno)
|===

=== Phase 6: Documentation & Community (Q2 2027)

**Goal**: Comprehensive documentation, examples, community engagement.

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Component |Description

|Specification Site
|Jekyll/AsciiDoc site with full JGD spec

|Tutorial Series
|Step-by-step guides for different domains (climate, genomics, social)

|Example Datasets

== Key Deliverables by Year

=== 2026

* ✓ Philosophical framework documented
* ✓ D_p/D_n classification defined
* [ ] Complete formal specification (EBNF, Idris2, Category Theory)
* [ ] Homoiconic container model implemented
* [ ] Metamorphic transformation library
* [ ] verisimdb integration operational
* [ ] First production D_p instances

=== 2027

* [ ] Full tooling suite (Zig, Rust, ReScript, Julia)
* [ ] Language bindings (Python, JavaScript)
* [ ] Comprehensive documentation
* [ ] Academic publication
* [ ] Community adoption begins
* [ ] Legacy migration path (VoID/DC/DCAT → JGD)

=== 2028+

* [ ] Widespread adoption as VoID successor
* [ ] Standard for data catalogs and federations
* [ ] Integration with major semantic web platforms
* [ ] Global D_p atlas (millions of databases indexed)
* [ ] Measurable expansion of "white box" coverage

== Success Metrics

=== Technical

* **JGD adoption**: >1000 D_p instances created
* **Atlas size**: >100,000 databases indexed in verisimdb
* **Coverage expansion**: White box grows from 15% → 25%
* **Blind spots identified**: >10,000 Zone 2 gaps cataloged
* **Transformations**: Round-trip tests pass 100%

=== Community

* **Contributors**: >50 active contributors
* **Organizations**: >10 institutions using JGD
* **Papers**: >5 academic citations
* **Talks**: Presented at Semantic Web, Data Science conferences
* **Forks**: >100 GitHub forks

=== Impact

* **Paradigm shift**: Data science discourse shifts from interpretability to exploration
* **Research prioritization**: Funding guided by JGD blind spot analysis
* **Data collection**: New sensors/instruments deployed based on coverage gaps
* **Epistemic humility**: Standard practice to acknowledge unknown unknowns

== Dependencies & Risks

=== Dependencies

* **verisimdb maturity**: Requires stable temporal versioning
* **Idris2 ecosystem**: Needs mature dependent types tooling
* **Category theory expertise**: Requires mathematical rigor
* **Community buy-in**: Adoption depends on demonstrating value

=== Risks
