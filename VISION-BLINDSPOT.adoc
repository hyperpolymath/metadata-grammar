== The Two Blind Spots

A paper in _Nature_ pointed out something profound about vision: We obsess over the **small blind spot**—the tiny area where the optic nerve connects to the retina. About 7.5° of visual field.

But there's a **much larger blind spot** we rarely think about: **Everything behind the front of our eyes.** The entire world behind us. Roughly 50% of the visual field—the world we cannot see at all without turning our heads.

== The Analogy to Data

=== The Small Blind Spot: Black Box Obsession

**What we've been obsessing over**: The "black box" problem in AI and data systems.

- Can we interpret this neural network?
- What's inside this opaque model?
- How do we explain this algorithm?

**Size of the problem**: Small. We built these systems. We can inspect them with effort.

**Equivalent to**: The optic nerve blind spot—a known, measurable gap we can work around.

=== The Huge Blind Spot: The Unseen World

**What we've been ignoring**: The unmeasured, unobserved reality beyond our data.

- What domains haven't we measured?
- What populations aren't in our datasets?
- What phenomena lack instrumentation?
- What's beyond the edge of our maps?

**Size of the problem**: VAST. Most of reality is unmeasured.

**Equivalent to**: The world behind us—the huge area we can't see without turning to look.

== The Inversion

**We've been staring at the optic nerve** (the small blind spot, the "black box") while **the entire world behind us remains unexplored** (the huge blind spot, the darkness).

**metadata-grammar** is about turning around. Looking at the darkness. Mapping the unknown.

== Why This Isn't Just "We Don't Know Everything"

**Expected objection**: "Of course we don't know everything. So what?"

**The point**: Not that we're incomplete. But that **we've been looking in the wrong direction.**

We've spent two decades obsessing over:
- Interpretability (understand the black box)
- Explainability (explain the optic nerve)
- Model inspection (stare at the small blind spot)

When we should have been asking:
- **Where haven't we looked?** (turn around)
- **What's in the darkness?** (explore the unknown)
- **Where are the blank spots?** (cartographic gaps)

**The paradigm shift**: From understanding our tools → exploring the territory.

== The Chronicle Aspect

**"Interlinked" is now redundant**: If everything is a database in the federation, interlinking is **inherent**, not special.

What metadata-grammar really captures is the **evolving chronicle**:
- How our knowledge grows over time
- How our maps improve as we explore
- How we catalogue the evolution of understanding
- The journal of our progressive cartography

**Not just**: "Grammar of Databases" (static rules)

**But**: "Cartographic Journal of Reality" (evolving chronicle)

verisimdb makes this temporal: We can query "What did we know on 2020-01-01?" and see our maps at that time. The chronicle is queryable.

== For Communication

**The core message for sharing this work**:

> We've been obsessing over the tiny blind spot (interpretability, black boxes) while ignoring the vast blind spot (unmeasured reality).
>
> Our databases are transparent—we built them. The darkness is outside.
>
> **metadata-grammar** is the cartographic standard for exploring that darkness. A chronicle of our progressive mapping of reality through phenomenal databases.
>
> The boxes are white. The territory is dark. Let's turn around and explore.
